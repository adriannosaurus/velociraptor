## Hello!

Apologies for the different Github repository. I made a silly mistake when trying to push the updated project to the original pterodactyl repo, and I don't currently have the time/bandwidth to troubleshoot it

I'm back, this time with working software and a basic understanding of the software I'm working with. Thank you again for the super quick crash course and the resources you provided regarding IntelliJ unit testing with JUnit! They were a huge help, and I felt so much more comfortable working with the tools

In this submission, the four of the classes (Distributor, Distributors, Inventory, Item) each have an associated test class. You will find some notes and train-of-thought work in the test classes, outlining the progress I made and acknowledging my setbacks/shortcomings. In short, I began overthinking what exactly was being tested and how to get the test scenarios where I needed them, which led to me confusing myself

As mentioned in the pterodactyl repository, there are a few extra files in the project showcasing other skills and trains of thought. They haven't been changed, but I am keeping them in the project


## Musings
I had a good time diving into this challenge problem! However, as I dove in, I realized that the skills needed to best excel in the challenge are a bit different than my current experience in Quality Engineering. My current realm of expertise is in working with and adding custom methods to a core library that will automate the execution of test scripts in a web-based system. This challenge forced me to focus solely on testing the code itself by creating custom unit test scenarios directly in the IDE

Despite the disparity in my current expertise and what this challenge had to offer, I still greatly enjoyed learning and problem solving with a new toolset! It was a very cool exercise in combining my business analyst background in thinking of test scenarios with my quality engineer background in coding. I hope to improve my knowledge and skills in this area :)

## Next Steps

I completely understand that it's difficult to assess someone's competency and coding skills on what essentially boils down to "just trust me." But I'm still confident that I would excel in this role once I settle in, learn the ropes, and get comfortable with the code library. I pride myself in being a fast learner in a supportive environment, and I still hope to have the opportunity to prove that to y'all

If my results of the coding challenge are still a dealbreaker, it was lovely to meet you all and I wish you the best in finding the ideal candidate for this awesome opportunity! :)
